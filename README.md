## What's this

This is just me keeping track of my experiments with my keyboard(s in the future?) with QMK firmware.

## What's it for

Currently it is only for [Keychron K3 Pro ISO layout](https://www.keychron.com/collections/keychron-iso-jis-keyboard-collection/products/keychron-k3-pro-qmk-via-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-iso-layout-collection) keyboard.

The 'official' QMK software seems to be [here](https://github.com/Keychron/qmk_firmware/tree/bluetooth_playground/keyboards/keychron/k3_pro)

## LICENSE

QMK itself seems to be under the GPLv2.

This means I'm also releasing everything under the same.
